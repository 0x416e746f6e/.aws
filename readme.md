Once you finish the setup process, you won't need to interact with the helper

then you can use these arguments.

### Use an existing aws config

After setup, you can specify a custom config file. This lets private
data like roles and account IDs to be managed privately.

```bash
~/.aws/helper.sh --custom-config /path/to/config # File
~/.aws/helper.sh --custom-config https://config  # URL
```
